# MigiBell-Static-Website

-- Developed a static frontend portfolio website for a hypothetical food stylist named Migi Bell as a part of Web Tech coursework assignments.

-- Demonstrated the power of HTML and CSS by making a professional website and adding some beautifully complex background-scrolling effects using the concepts of parallax without any use of JavaScript at all for any functionality.
